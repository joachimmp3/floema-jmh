# 💍 Floema

Floema is a showcase website for a fake jewelry company. It uses the following tech :

* Prismic
* WebGL 
* HTML/Pug
* SCSS
* Plain ol' Javascript

Complete ressources for this website (images and prototypes) can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/5BIhgSib#LtQ2X6f1H8ytmKx9f4u7NQ)


# Example

See Floema up and running [here](https://floema-jmh.onrender.com) (please be patient, the instance needs to spin up first !) : 


# Installation

> ⚠ Important : Floema uses Prismic as a headless CMS. Create and account and import the JSON files in the ``prismic`` folder to your Custom Type Builder. You should then be able to import all images needed for the project.

Install dependencies :

``npm install``

Create your environnement file : 

``cp .env.example .env``

Start your local server : 

``npm run start``
